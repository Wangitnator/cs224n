# CS224n: Natural Language Processing with Deep Learning, Winter 2019
Solutions for CS224n: Natural Language Processing with Deep Learning, Winter 2019

Here are my own solutions to all homeworks, for Prof. Christopher Masters-Level [course](http://cs229.stanford.edu/) on NLP + Deep Learning

Each homework assignment's solutions are presented as a jupyter notebook, linking to python .py files germaine to relevant portions of each assignment. The top-level jupytaer notebooks are listed below.

NOTE: 
- All errors are my own.
- Because I completed the course materials independently (without access to Teaching Assistants or Recitations), I did consult other CS224n solutions online, to better understand questions, esp. for Assignment 5 + Highway Networks, and to debug Homeworks 4 & 5 (turns out error I was experiencing, was caused by using later version of pytorch, than version used for course. I had used later version, b/c I didn't know how to downgrade versions using pip).
